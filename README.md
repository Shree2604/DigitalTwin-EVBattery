# DigitalTwin-EVBattery-
This project mirrors real or simulated EV battery behavior in Unity 3D and predicts Remaining Useful Life (RUL) using time-series models. Real-time data from sensors (via ESP32) is transmitted to the cloud using MQTT and visualized through a dynamic web dashboard with OPC UA interoperability.
