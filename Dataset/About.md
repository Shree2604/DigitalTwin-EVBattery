# About Dataset

The **EVIoT-PredictiveMaint Dataset** is a comprehensive real-world dataset collected from IoT-enabled electric vehicles (EVs) operating in diverse environments. It captures **multi-modal telemetry**, **environmental conditions**, and **historical maintenance records** at 15-minute intervals over a 5-year period (January 2020 to January 2025).

This dataset is designed for **multi-horizon predictive maintenance** in EV fleet management, supporting **federated learning** applications for failure prediction, maintenance scheduling, and component health assessment.

With **175,393 records**, the dataset is well-suited for research in **predictive maintenance**, **failure analysis**, and **energy optimization** in electric vehicle fleets. It includes sensor data, telematics, environmental conditions, and maintenance history, enabling advanced machine learning models for predicting vehicle reliability and optimizing maintenance strategies.


## Features in EVIoT-PredictiveMaint Dataset

The dataset consists of **30+ features** categorized into eight major groups:

### 1. Battery System Monitoring
- **SoC (State of Charge)** – Battery charge percentage  
- **SoH (State of Health)** – Battery degradation level  
- **Battery Voltage** – Voltage levels across the battery pack  
- **Battery Current** – Current drawn or supplied by the battery  
- **Battery Temperature** – Temperature of battery cells  
- **Charge Cycles** – Total charge-discharge cycles of the battery  

### 2. Electric Motor and Drivetrain Monitoring
- **Motor Temperature** – Temperature of the electric motor  
- **Motor Vibration** – Vibration levels indicating wear or imbalance  
- **Motor Torque** – Torque generated by the motor  
- **Motor RPM** – Revolutions per minute of the motor
